# Smart-Controlling-of-Temperature-using-Arduino-with-NRF-Communication


The scope of this project is to design and implement an advanced temperature control system using an
Arduino microcontroller and an LM 35 temperature sensor. The system incorporates a relay to
automatically switch off a fan and bulb when the temperature exceeds a predefined threshold.
Communication between the system components is established using an NRF module, and the sensed
values are transmitted to the cloud through an ESP32 Node MCU module for remote monitoring. A
custom mobile application and website enable real-time temperature data visualization and analysis.
