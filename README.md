# Smart-Controlling-of-Temperature-using-Arduino-with-NRF-Communication
For a given Threshold Temperature Arduino will Trigger the Relay and Control the Switching of Fan and Bulb

In this project we have implemented a relay which controls the switch of bulb and fan 
according to the threshold value of temperature in LM35 which is programmed in Arduino 
the data is passed to NRF transmitter to send it to the receiver side which sends the data to 
Node MCU and also display the value in LCD display .The displayed values are also stored 
in webserver via Node MCU
